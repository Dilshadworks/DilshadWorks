Glad to see you here!
I'm software a software engineer. Who love to solve problems using technologies. I believe there is no language and tools in the IT industry, which we call a silver bullet. Every tool and language will be deprecated with the passage of time. Therefore, I must say, I am not tools and language-oriented. Rather, I am problem-solving and critical skills-oriented, and I do not wanna deprecate myself with tools deprecation.
